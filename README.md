# AXI4-Lite-Peripheral-Design-Verification
This project implements a custom AXI4-Lite slave peripheral in Verilog, verified with SystemVerilog testbench, and packaged as a Vivado Custom IP. It demonstrates end-to-end flow: RTL design → simulation → IP packaging → SoC integration with MicroBlaze/Zynq → software validation using Vitis SDK.
