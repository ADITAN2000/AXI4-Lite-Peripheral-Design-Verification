# AXI4-Lite-Peripheral-Design-Verification
This project implements a custom AXI4-Lite slave peripheral in Verilog, verified with SystemVerilog testbench, and packaged as a Vivado Custom IP. It demonstrates end-to-end flow: RTL design â†’ simulation â†’ IP packaging â†’ SoC integration with MicroBlaze/Zynq â†’ software validation using Vitis SDK.
- Implements AXI4-Lite protocol (read/write channels with handshakes).
- Supports 4 32-bit memory-mapped registers (0x00, 0x04, 0x08, 0x0C).
- Synthesizable RTL design, verified via testbench.
- Compatible with FPGA integration in Xilinx Vivado.
- Modular and extendable for additional peripherals.
